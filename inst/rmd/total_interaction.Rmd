### `r h.i`.`r h.ii` Interaction analysis
We use [`CellPhoneDB`](https://www.cellphonedb.org/) to analyze the interaction at the boundary of two clusters. The boundaries of clusters are detected automatically and those whose area is larger than `r interaction.region.threshold` are used to analyze interactions.

The results of interaction analysis includes many area, please check detailed results in [interact/](./interact/)

```{r echo=F}
h.ii <- h.ii + 1
```
